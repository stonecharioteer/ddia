# Notes on Designing Data Intensive Applications

I am studying the DDIA book with practical applications. To do so, I'm using Google Gemini and I've asked it to give me
exercises for each chapter. I will be using Python, Go, Docker, k3d, postgres, mongodb, neo4j, kafka, hadoop, spark and
temporal to do these exercises. I plan to use these tools so that I understand the underlying concepts in each of these
chapters beyond just skimming through the book. I might convert this into a blog article once done.
